# Inventory_Mangement_System



This project is aimed at developing a desktop based application named Inventory Management 
System for managing the inventory system of the New Building at Department of Industrial 
Management. The Inventory Management System (IMS) refers to the system and processes to 
manage the stock of the department with the involvement of Technology system. This system 
can be used to view the details of the available inventory, enter new items to inventory, update 
the existing inventory and remove items from the inventory. It is a small window based 
application which has admin component to manage the inventory and maintenance of the 
inventory system. 


Instructions to use the software

Figure 1 displays the login page which is created in order to protect the management of the 
inventory of the department in order to prevent it from the threads and misuse of the inventory. 
As software starts the login page appears. Admin login is determined by the username and 
password that has all the authority to add, view, update and remove the items in the inventory 
as per the requirement. By entering username as “ admin@gmail.com “ and the password as 
“admin1 “, admin can log in to the system. In here we also provide options to clear user name 
and password if when they make mistakes when typing those things and also if admin forgot the 
password there is an option to make new password to the system. In addition, there is an exit 
option too, when admin want to quit the software.


Required tools for the development of the system
• Apache NetBeans IDE 12.5
• MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE

Project Limitation
• allowed only Single admin to use.

User Interface
To create the user interface in Java NetBeans we use jButton, jLabels, jPanel, jTextBox and 
jFrames
